1. LET vs VAR vs CONST.

        // 1. What are var and const in JavaScript?
        - var : the keyword that tells JavaScript you're declaring a variable.
        - const: that the identifier can't be reassigned.

        // 2. What are the differences between let and var?
        
        *let:                               
        - is block scoped.
        - can be updated but not re-declared                     
        - the let keyword is not initialized                     
                                                                             
        *var:
        - declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.
        - can be re-declared and updated
        - are hoisted to the top of its scope and initialized with a value of undefined.

        // 3. What are the differences between let and const?
        - let can be updated but not re-declared
        - const cannot be updated or re-declared
        - let can be re-assigned, but variables declared with const canâ€™t be.

        // 4. What to use in what cases?

        *let: used when we allow to update the value of the variable but does not allow us to re-declared the variable.
        - example:

        let greeting = "say Hi";
        console.log(greeting); //"say Hi"

        greeting = "say Hello instead";
        console.log(greeting); //"say Hello instead"

        *var: used when a variable is declared outside a function.
        - example:

        var greeting = "hey hi";
        var times = 4;

        if (times > 3) {
            var greeting = "say Hello instead"; 
        }

        console.log(greeting); //"say Hello instead"

        *const: 
        - used when we want the value of a variable declared to remain the same within its scope.
        - use const when you declare:
           + A new Array
           + A new Object
           + A new Function
           + A new RegExp

        - example:

        const greeting = {
            message : "Hello",
            number : "five"
        }

        greeting.message = "say Hello instead";
        console.log(greeting); // {message:"say Hello instead",number:"five"}

2. BOOLEAN
        
        // 1. What is Boolean?
        - Boolean is a datatype that returns either of two values i.e. true or false
        - In JavaScript, Boolean is used as a function to get the value of a variable, object, conditions, expressions, etc. in terms of true or false.

        // 2. What results in Boolean?
        - The boolean type has only two values: true and false.
